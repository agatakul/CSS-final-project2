              Hi, I'm Agata, a 30 something year old Polish living in the south of Spain.
              You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. [click for more]</summary>
            
              My background <br>
              While some family members might feel creating custom USB rechargeable heated gloves for my sister's Christmas gift is the pinnacle of my career, as fondly as they are remembered each December at the family dinner, they are rather an expression of what I truly love creating - friendly aesthetic solutions that make their users happy and serve a practical purpose. 
              <br><br>
              My educational path was two-pronged, I started off studying and graduating from Electronics and Communication with a Bachelor's degree, followed by a period of MA in Advanced Applied Electronics. 
              <br><br>
              Missing the human factor and interaction, I switched my Master's to English Philology to pursue 5 years of teaching the aforementioned rowdy yet adorable children. One Friday afternoon, staring at my computer screen it dawned on me how much I miss programming and coding. After brushing up my skills, which included completing Codedex' Python, HTML, CSS & JavaScript course and Harvard CS50 course; I am very excited to be working in this field of immense opportunities again. I enjoy creating functional and aesthetically pleasing designs and solutions.
              <br><br>
              In my free time I love exploring the world, meeting people from different countries and tasting new cuisines. These traveling experiences, whether it's hitchhiking across Norway, cave diving in Montenegro, parachute jumping in Hawaii, taught me that these unique moments are memorable yet rare occurrences and it is not them but rather our day-to-day reality that constitute the bulk of our life and everyday existence. My outlook on programming emerged from these observations - I believe in creating user-friendly, down-to-earth and practical solutions and designs which can assist us in our daily lives.
